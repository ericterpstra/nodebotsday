# Notes

The J5IK, while awesome, is cost prohibitive for our audience.  We will likely go with a SumoBot Jr build with a Particle Photon as the brains.  The Mid-South makers will graciously allow the use of their laser cutter to create the pieces. Ordered parts should be around USD $60.  Cost of tickets will be subsidized by HACKMemphis and the Memphis Technology Foundation.
